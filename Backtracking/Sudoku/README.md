Note: You must update the input argument A (partially completed grid of Sudoku) to submit your solved Sudoko grid.

Example :

For the above given diagrams, the corresponding input to your program will be
```
[
[53..7....],
[6..195...],
[.98....6.],
[8...6...3],
[4..8.3..1], 
[7...2...6],
[.6....28.], 
[...419..5],
[....8..79]]

```
and we would expect your program to modify the above array of array of characters to

```
[
[534678912],
[672195348],
[198342567],
[859761423],
[426853791],
[713924856],
[961537284],
[287419635], 
[345286179]]
